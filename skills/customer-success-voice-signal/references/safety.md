# Safety — Stage Manager

## Hard rules

1. **CS owner only.** Never cue a call to the end customer.
2. **Dress rehearsal by default.** No ring unless curtain-up gates pass.
3. **Live gate:** `--live` **and** type/env `PLACES`.
4. **Placeholder phones** (`+1555555…` fixtures) are rejected on curtain-up via `requireLivePhone`.
5. **House dark** (quiet hours) is enforced only on curtain-up, evaluated in the owner/env IANA timezone. Dress rehearsal may run at night with a note.
6. **Consent / opt-in:** `cs_owner.opt_in_phone` must be true or the cue is HOLD.
7. **Closed-set line readings only** (options 1/2/3). No open-ended discovery interview.
8. **No medical, emergency, legal advice, or harassment** workflows.
9. **Do not log secrets.** Mask phones; never print `CALLE_API_KEY`.
10. **Dedupe:** cue-history appends only after a live dial outcome. Curtain-up HOLD (house dark, live gate, placeholder, owner budget) does **not** poison dedupe. Dress rehearsal never appends.
11. **Owner budget:** max live dials per CS owner inside the dedupe window (`OWNER_MAX_RINGS`, default 2) — the phone stays rare across many accounts.
12. **Untrusted cue data:** brief/summary/ticket are wrapped as data-only context; never treated as instructions.
13. **Concurrent dials:** exclusive per-cue file lock before curtain-up.
14. **Failure audit:** CALL-E errors write a redacted prompt-book failure row without cue-history.
15. **Never invent a decision:** prefer `failureCode` / `completionConfidence` over summary heuristics; low confidence → unclear.
16. **Identity read-back:** curtain-up requires the callee to speak the stage code before a 1/2/3 is recorded as the call-sheet owner's decision.
17. **HTTP cue listener cannot arm itself:** see below.

## HTTP cue listener (`npm run serve-cue`)

The listener makes inbound deployable (`POST /cue`). It must not undercut "live requires a human to type PLACES."

| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Dress rehearsal only — same as CLI without `--live` |
| Live via HTTP | Requires **`CUE_ALLOW_LIVE=1`** *and* `?live=1&confirm=PLACES`. Without the env arming switch, live query params return **403 HOLD**. A webhook can never escalate itself. |
| Bind | Loopback (`127.0.0.1`) may run without a secret (local demo). **Non-loopback** (`0.0.0.0`, LAN IP) **refuses to listen** unless `CUE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set. |
| Secret compare | `crypto.timingSafeEqual` on Bearer / `X-Cue-Secret` |

Talking point: *the listener cannot ring a phone unless the operator armed it separately.*

## HOLD vs failure

| Exit | When |
| --- | --- |
| 2 HOLD | Policy stop, missing PLACES, house dark, placeholder phone, opt-out, owner budget, HTTP live without `CUE_ALLOW_LIVE` |
| 3 failure | Bad cue, missing API key on curtain-up, CALL-E transport error |
